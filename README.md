# Bayesian_Statistics

In this repository, we will go through three activities of Bayesian Statistics.

## Bayesian Inference

Bayesian inference is an approach to statistical inference that is specifically based on the use of Bayesian probability to summarize evidence.

## Statistical Modelling using Bayesian Statistics

The formulation of statistical models using Bayesian statistics has the identifying feature of requiring the specification of prior distributions for any unknown parameters. 

Parameters of prior distributions may themselves have prior distributions, 
  *leading to Bayesian hierarchical modeling, 
  *or may be interrelated, leading to Bayesian networks.
  
 ## Bayesian design of experiments
 
This approach uses sequential analysis techniques to include the outcome of earlier experiments in the design of the next experiment. This is achieved by updating 'beliefs' through the use of prior and posterior distribution. This allows the design of experiments to make good use of resources of all types.

## Statistical graphics

Statistical graphics
Statistical graphics includes methods for data exploration, for model validation, etc. The use of certain modern computational techniques for Bayesian inference, specifically the various types of Markov chain Monte Carlo techniques, have led to the need for checks, often made in graphical form, on the validity of such computations in expressing the required posterior distributions.
